Cell labeling by Colloidal Janus Nanoparticles: 
In the master’s thesis project at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata, I have been 
working on two interdisciplinary group projects since August 2023. Synthesizing <50 nm colloidal Janus 
nanoparticles possessing two dissimilar surfaces in a single particle is challenging, requiring advanced 
characterization. To illuminate intriguing phenomena that may arise from the interaction of nanoparticles 
with cellular membranes, one project focuses on synthesizing Janus nanoparticles functionalized with 
dextran and decylamine to enhance cellular uptake bypassing the endocytic pathway and investigating 
subcellular targeting mechanisms. The second project deals with developing sub-60 nm urease-powered 
Janus nanomotors to move in a particular direction in biological fluid, driven by the catalytic activity of 
urease, converting urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide gases for better cellular uptake and drug delivery. 
I am trying to justify the movement of the nanomotor by documenting its motion in a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 
epifluorescence microscope with a 63× objective and exploring different optimization methods for the same 
using dynamic light scattering (DLS).
